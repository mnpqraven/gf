# Teambuilding <a name="teambuilding"></a>
What you need: lots of FP and the following:

  - Dolls
    - 7 AR teams
    - Night ARs are recommended: OTs-14, 9a-91, T91, T65 (not currently in EN)
    - FP RFs: Lee Enfield, M14, M200, IWS-2000
  - Fairies
    - around 2-69 airstrike
    - 4-20 shield
    - n paradrops
      - Some optimal loadouts:
        - 2 illumine 2 para 2 airstrike 1 shield 3 wildcard
        - 2 illumine 2 para 6 airstrike

  - n for n

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# WIP AREA
#<++>
#1 Gunboat
#1 Agent team
#4 AR teams
#3 RF teams
#1 SGMG
#
#2 para/illu
#1 warrior/mortar (3 stars)
#3 Airstrike
#1 Chloe
#<++>
#<++>
#2x illumine, 2x para, 3x airstrike (all must be SL10)
#1x warrior, 1x mortar (gunboat)
#1x shield (agent, optional)
#<++> ceia
#<++>
#Tarantula(Arm. Dog)x80 Manticore(Quad Pod)x6
#zas wouldn't do too well here
#might as well sl10 airstrike and have FP ARs finish the job
#Scoutsx20 Ripper(SMG)x15 Vespid(AR)x20
#this node too, might as well airstrike it
#since the vespids have 470 hp
#<++> ceia
#<++>
#Turn 1 use para team to kill agent. Don’t care about losses.
#Turn 2 use 1 illu team to light up top middle/bottom’s 3 SF helipads area, and paradrop the 2 para teams to helipads.
#Turn 3 use the other illu team to light up the other 3 SF helipad area, and retreat both the para teams. Redeploy them and capture SF helipads. (After retreating can repair the team that was used to fight agent).
#Also at the same turn, use other illu team to capture the radar on bottom left.
#Turn 4 and onward have no fixed routes, gotta adapt to the situation.
#<++> ceia
#<++>
#Agent can be defeated whenever, and the only benefit of defeating her early is having the ability to defeat the tanks that spawn near Agent
#And SF bosses score given is static iirc
#Regardless of health loss
#<++> corsage
